# Euro Lottery Penetration Testing

This directory contains penetration testing scripts, results, and recommendations for the Euro Lottery application.

## Penetration Testing Plan

### 1. Authentication Testing

- Brute force password attempts
- JWT token manipulation tests
- Session management tests
- Authentication bypass attempts

### 2. Authorization Testing

- Privilege escalation tests
- Horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other user data)
- Resource access controls
- Admin function access by regular users

### 3. API Security Testing

- Parameter manipulation
- SQL injection attempts
- CSRF testing
- XSS testing through API endpoints
- API input fuzzing

### 4. Lottery Mechanism Testing

- RNG prediction attempts
- Draw manipulation tests
- Prize calculation verification
- Timing attacks on draw execution

### 5. Infrastructure Testing

- Network scanning
- Platform fingerprinting
- Dependency scanning
- Known vulnerability testing

## Running Tests

Testing should be performed in a controlled environment using the following tools:

1. OWASP ZAP for automated vulnerability scanning
2. Burp Suite for API testing
3. Custom scripts for lottery mechanism testing

```bash
# Example command to run API fuzzing tests
python3 fuzz_api_endpoints.py --target=https://test-eurolottery.example.com/api/ --auth-token=$TEST_TOKEN
```

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

All discovered vulnerabilities should be reported using the following format:

- Vulnerability name
- Risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
- Description
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact
- Recommended mitigation

## Penetration Testing Schedule

1. Initial scan: Start of project
2. Pre-launch full penetration test: 2 weeks before launch
3. Regular security scans: Monthly
4. Full penetration test: Quarterly
