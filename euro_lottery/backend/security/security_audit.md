# Euro Lottery Security Audit Report

## Overview

This document outlines the security audit performed for the Euro Lottery application, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and security best practices.

## Key Findings

### Authentication & Authorization

✅ **JWT Implementation**
- Using `djangorestframework-simplejwt` with secure configuration
- Token rotation is enabled with `ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS=True`
- Token blacklisting is enabled for invalidated tokens
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with longer refresh tokens (7 days)

✅ **Permission Controls**
- All endpoints use appropriate permission classes
- Admin-only endpoints use `IsAdminUser` permission
- User data is properly isolated by owner

⚠️ **Password Policies**
- No minimum password complexity requirements
- No account lockout after failed attempts
- No multi-factor authentication option

### Data Protection

✅ **Encryption**
- HTTPS enforced through settings (when deployed)
- Sensitive API keys stored as environment variables
- Payment information stored with partial masking (last 4 digits only)

⚠️ **PII Handling**
- User email addresses stored in plaintext
- IP addresses logged without clear retention policy
- User-agent information stored without anonymization

### API Security

✅ **Input Validation**
- Comprehensive validation in serializers
- Number range checks for lottery tickets
- Transaction amount validation

⚠️ **Rate Limiting**
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- No rate limiting on ticket purchase endpoints
- Potential for brute force attacks

### Database Security

✅ **ORM Usage**
- Using Django ORM with parameterized queries
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- No raw SQL queries that could lead to injection

⚠️ **Data Access Controls**
- No row-level security enforcement at database level
- Database roles not implemented with least privilege
- No encryption for data at rest

### Lottery Security & Fairness

✅ **Random Number Generation**
- Using secure RNG with cryptographic principles
- Multiple entropy sources for seed generation
- Public verification mechanisms

✅ **Draw Verification**
- Hash-based verification for draw results
- Comprehensive logging of all draw activities
- Separate verification function for integrity checks

⚠️ **Audit Trail**
- Limited logging of administrative actions
- No independent verification of results by third party
- Verification mechanism not documented for users

## Vulnerability Assessment

| Vulnerability | Risk Level | Description | Recommendation |
|---------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Password Policy | Medium | No minimum requirements | Implement password complexity requirements |
| Rate Limiting | High | Missing on critical endpoints | Add rate limiting using Django Rest Framework throttling |
| Session Management | Medium | No explicit invalidation | Add endpoint for manual session invalidation |
| PII Storage | Medium | PII stored without encryption | Encrypt or hash sensitive personal data |
| Logging Practices | Low | Inconsistent logging of actions | Implement centralized logging with structured format |

## Compliance Assessment

| Regulation | Status | Gaps | Recommendations |
|------------|--------|------|-----------------|
| GDPR | Partial | Data retention policy missing | Document retention periods, implement auto-deletion |
| PCI DSS | Partial | Payment data flow not fully documented | Create data flow diagrams, implement card data tokenization |
| Gaming Regulations | Partial | Audit records not comprehensive | Implement complete audit logging of all lottery operations |

## Security Improvement Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement rate limiting on all auth endpoints
2. Add password complexity requirements
3. Encrypt PII data at rest
4. Implement IP filtering for admin endpoints

### Short-term (1-3 months)
1. Add multi-factor authentication for admin users
2. Implement account lockout after failed attempts
3. Perform penetration testing
4. Improve comprehensive audit logging

### Long-term (3-6 months)
1. Implement third-party RNG verification
2. Add real-time fraud detection
3. Complete security documentation
4. Conduct regular security training

## Conclusion

The Euro Lottery application has implemented many security best practices, particularly around authentication, input validation, and lottery fairness mechanisms. However, several vulnerabilities need to be addressed, especially around rate limiting, password policies, and PII protection.
